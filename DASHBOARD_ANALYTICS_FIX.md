# Dashboard Sales Analytics Fix

## Problem
The sales analytics in the dashboard were not updating properly. They showed Rs. 0 for today's sales despite having completed orders worth Rs. 1,474.19.

## Root Cause
**Data Source Mismatch**: The dashboard was looking at the `Sales` table for analytics data, but the billing system (which we just fixed) creates records in the `Orders` table. This created a disconnect where:

- **Billing System**: Creates `Order` records with invoice numbers
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Was only reading from `Sales` table 
- **Result**: Dashboard showed Rs. 0 despite actual sales

## Solution
Updated the `DashboardController` to read sales data from the `Orders` table instead of the `Sales` table, since that's where the actual billing data is stored.

## Files Modified

### `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`

**Changes Made**:

1. **Updated Today's Sales Calculation**:
   ```php
   // OLD: Reading from Sales table
   $todaySales = Sales::whereDate('created_at', $today)
       ->where('type', 'sale')
       ->where('status', 'completed')
       ->sum('total_amount');

   // NEW: Reading from Orders table
   $todaySales = Order::whereDate('created_at', $today)
       ->where('status', 'completed')
       ->whereNotNull('invoice_number')
       ->sum('final_amount');
   ```

2. **Updated Refunds Calculation**:
   ```php
   // OLD: From Sales table
   $todayRefunds = Sales::whereDate('created_at', $today)
       ->where('type', 'refund')
       ->sum('total_amount');

   // NEW: From Orders table
   $todayRefunds = Order::whereDate('created_at', $today)
       ->where(function($query) {
           $query->where('status', 'refunded')
                 ->orWhere('final_amount', '<', 0);
       })
       ->sum(DB::raw('ABS(final_amount)'));
   ```

3. **Updated Monthly Revenue**:
   - Changed from `Sales` table to `Orders` table
   - Uses `final_amount` instead of `total_amount`
   - Filters by `status = 'completed'` and `invoice_number IS NOT NULL`

4. **Updated Chart Data Methods**:
   - `getDailyChartData()`: Now reads from Orders
   - `getWeeklyChartData()`: Now reads from Orders  
   - `getMonthlyChartData()`: Now reads from Orders
