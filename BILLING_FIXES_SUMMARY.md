## Additional Fixes (500 Error Resolution)

### **Critical Bug Fix: Bill Creation 500 Error**
**Problem**: Clicking "Generate Bill" button resulted in HTTP 500 error with message "Failed to create bill: HTTP error! status: 500"

**Root Causes Found and Fixed**:

1. **Database Constraint: discount_type Cannot Be Null**
   - Error: `Column 'discount_type' cannot be null`
   - Fix: Set default value `'fixed_amount'` for discount_type field
   - Location: `app/Http/Controllers/BillingController.php` line 660

2. **Invalid ENUM Value for discount_type**
   - Error: `Data truncated for column 'discount_type'`
   - Problem: Attempted to use `'none'` value, but ENUM only allows `['percentage', 'fixed_amount']`
   - Fix: Use `'fixed_amount'` as default instead of `'none'`

3. **Duplicate Invoice Number Generation**
   - Error: `Duplicate entry 'INV-000059' for key 'orders.orders_invoice_number_unique'`
   - Problem: Invoice number generation was not checking for existing numbers
   - Fix: Enhanced invoice number generation with uniqueness check and proper sequential numbering
   - Location: `app/Http/Controllers/BillingController.php` lines 582-606

4. **Customer Creation Issues for Cash Customers**

   - Fix: Added all required customer fields with default values
   - Location: `app/Http/Controllers/BillingController.php` lines 543-554

5. **Frontend Data Type Consistency**
   - Problem: JavaScript sending inconsistent discount_type values
   - Fix: Ensured frontend always sends valid ENUM values (`'percentage'` or `'fixed_amount'`)
   - Location: `resources/views/admin/billing/index.blade.php` line 1125

### **Testing Results**
